# Introduction
We have had issues with the flow module since it was replaced in February.

We have been in contact with LI-COR technical support, and have tried various solutions.

# Troubleshooting
First, we tried a larger filter size.

# Simulations
Did some computer simulations using a modelled flow module.

# Methods
We tried lots of things. SOme were logical. Some were not.

# Results
Nothing seemed to work

# Figures
Figures go in their own section of a draft paper.

# Conclusions
We have made some progress.
